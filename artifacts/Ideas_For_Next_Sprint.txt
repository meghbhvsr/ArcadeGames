Game Ideas


* Arcade games
   * A website full of arcade-like minigames:
      * Shooter
      * Runner game(e.g. Subway surfers)
      * Racing
      * Tetris
      * Snake
      * Pong
      * Air hockey
      * Pinball
      * Simulators
      * Bowling
   * This might be the best idea as arcade games won't be too hard to make, and we can have a platform that has multiple arcade games
   * We can have leaderboards, so players can get high scores and compete with one another. Let’s us create a sign-in system and save scores in a database, both fairly simple and will please Greg
   * There are alot of various options for arcade games that we can decently implement in the time frame we have and create multiple quality games.
* Roguelike dungeon roaming game
   * This could be very interesting, but it might take too long to create a roguelike that is actually good
   * Pretty easy to expand as we can start with just a single level with only a few stats/items but can expand to a large game throughout the weeks
* Idle Game
   * Cookie Clicker-esque
   * Simple but infinitely expandable
* Board game
   * Board games such as sorry, risk, monopoly, code names, etc.
   * Could get very complicated to program
* Story game - text based with images
   * Just an idea. Simple, but doesnt seem too interesting, and I don't know how much we could do with it
* Crossword game
   * This game can be expanded upon to include a crossword maker to allow the user to make their own levels to share with friends
* Parkour Puzzle Game
   * Can start very simple and added upon through more intricate mechanics such as wind, grabbing surfaces, double jumps, etc




* Collectible Game
   * Have a website with hard to reach pages that each add a “collectible” to the users profile that they can see. They can also see which ones they do not have.
