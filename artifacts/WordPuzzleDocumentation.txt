Design Choices for the Word Puzzle Game Integration

Development Process:

The integration of the word puzzle game into our website follows a scavenger hunt theme, designed to engage users in a multi-step puzzle that spans across several games hosted on our site.
The process will begin with identifying key interaction points within our existing games (Snake, Air Hockey, Memory Game) where we could seamlessly introduce clues without disrupting the user experience.
Each clue is strategically placed to guide players from one game to the next, leading in the discovery of a secret page.


Design Decisions:

- Clues were integrated in a manner that feels natural within the context of each game. For the Snake game, reaching a certain score reveals a console.log message with a 
clue pointing to the Air Hockey game.
- For the Air Hockey game, a clue is given when the player has hit a hat-trick. The screen will display "Hat Trick!!!" while highlighting the letters 'c' and 't' for the word "secret"
- The final clue within the Memory Game is going to be designed to reveal upon a certain pattern being clicked by the user before playing the game.
- The chosen words and hints all relate to a theme of  for our site exploration. The final "prize word" is designed to be a hyperlink text that will send it to a possible meme.

User Instructions:

- Starting Point: Begin by playing the Snake game. Aim for a high score to uncover the first clue.
- Follow the Clues: Stay alert for clues hidden within console messages, specific game instructions, and unique completion screens. These hints are your guide to the next stage of the game sequence.
